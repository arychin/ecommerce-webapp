// save ts and its types as dev dependency
npm i --save-dev typescript @types/express @types/node

tsc command builds the ts file and creates a new repo 
'dist' to store the generated js files

make sure to make the scripts out of building, 
starting & running commands

use "tsc -w" to continuosly watch for changes done in 
the ts, this will automatically map the changes to the 
js files in dist and you'd not have to rebuild 
(make a script out of this too)
